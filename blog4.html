    <h1>WHY IT AND NOT EDUCATION</h1>
	<p>Choosing a college course is a big decision, and for me, it wasn't straightforward.
	Originally, my top choices were different from Information Technology (IT), but due 
    to family reasons, I ended up in IT at ISU, even though it was my last option out of five.
    <br><br>One of the questions I often get from my instructors is why I didn't go for Education, 
    especially considering my knack for engaging presentations.
	They've seen my reporting styleâ€”how I make things interactive with games, use creative acronyms, 
    and spice up my presentations with videos and photos. I even walk around while explaining and 
    surprise my listeners with questions. <br><br>My enthusiasm for these activities might make it 
    seem like Education would be a perfect fit for me. The truth is, even though I excel at engaging 
    an audience, I didn't choose Education because I realized that I don't have the patience required 
    for teaching, particularly to younger students. Teaching requires a lot of dedication and 
    patience, qualities I found lacking in myself when I considered working in that field.
	<br><br>So, while IT wasn't my first choice, it became a practical and fitting option given my 
    circumstances. I might not have chosen Education, but I'm making the most of my IT journey, 
    applying my creativity and reporting skills in new ways.
