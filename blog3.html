    <h1>WHY "MALEFICENT" IS MY PEN NAME</h1>
    <p>	I still remember the day a friend of mine saw a sketch I had made for her. 
        She was amazed by the drawing, but her surprise turned into curiosity 
        when she noticed the name "Maleficent" written below it. She actually 
        doubted whether I was the artist or if I had borrowed the sketch from somewhere else.
        <br><br>Choosing <i>"Maleficent"</i> as my pen name was deeply personal and tied to a 
        challenging period in my life. After my first break-up, I found solace in sketching 
        and used art as an outlet to express my feelings. During that time, I chose the name 
        <i>"Maleficent"</i> for my sketches because I felt a connection to the character.
        <br><br>Maleficent, with her story of betrayal and reclaiming power, resonated with me. 
        I saw her as a reflection of my own journey through heartbreak and healing.
        Using her name was like a way of embracing my emotions and turning them into something 
        meaningful. Although I don't use <i>"Maleficent"</i> as my pen name anymore
        it was an important part of my artistic journey. It helped me channel my pain into 
        creativity and provided a way to express my emotions during a tough time.
        <br><br>Looking back, I'm grateful for the inspiration it gave me and the personal 
        growth that came with it.
