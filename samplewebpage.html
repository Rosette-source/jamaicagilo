    <h2>STEPS TO KEEP MOTIVATED</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Know your goals, get your pen and paper, list them and pin it in your room.</li>
        <li>Discipline yourself and make a schedule. Set them in your alarm.</li>
        <li>Don't neglect your schedule on simultaneous days. It maybe hard at first and that's okay, just don't forget it totally. What matters is that atleast you still have the courage intact to you that's why you still follow your schedule after a skip.</li>
        <li>When feel sad and tired, watch motivational podcasts and interviews online or read books to recharge yourself.</li>
        <li>Lastly, this may surprise you. Get envy. Get envy in a sense that you "oh, he/she's so good, I also want that, I can't be just what I am today."</li>
