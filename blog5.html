    <h1>WHY ENGLISH, NOT SCIENCE</h1>
    <p>	When choosing between English and Science, my heart definitely leans towards English, 
        and here's why. <br><br>For me, English is a world of creativity and expression. 
        I love playing with words, crafting stories, and exploring different styles of writing.
        Whether it's writing essays, analyzing literature, or simply enjoying a good book, 
        English gives me a space to let my imagination run wild. It's like having a canvas 
        where I can paint with words, and that's something I find incredibly fulfilling.
        <br><br>Science, while fascinating with its experiments and discoveries, often feels 
        more rigid and structured. It's all about precise methods, theories, and calculations.
        While I appreciate the rigor of Science, it doesn't offer the same level of creative 
        freedom that English does. The structure and rules in Science are necessary, but they 
        can also be limiting compared to the open-ended nature of writing and storytelling.
        <br><br>Moreover, I've always felt more confident and engaged when it comes to English. 
        I enjoy diving into texts, discussing themes, and connecting with others through stories.
        It's a field that allows me to connect on a personal level and explore ideas in a way 
        that resonates with me. That said, I recognize the value of Science and am keen to learn 
        more about it. I'm actually actively looking for someone knowledgeable in Science who 
        can share insights and help me understand concepts I might not fully grasp.
        <br><br>Balancing my love for English with a curiosity for Science is important, 
        and having someone to guide me in that area would be incredibly valuable.
        <br><br>In summary, my preference for English over Science is driven by a passion for 
        creativity and personal expression. English provides a space for imaginative exploration 
        that I find deeply satisfying. At the same time, I'm eager to expand my understanding 
        of Science with the help of someone knowledgeable into it.
